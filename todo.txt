Shortlist:
- Containers! Block quotes, Lists
- mdast compiler, mdast-util-to-markdown
- Extensions (frontmatter, gfm, mdx, directives, footnotes)
- Performance

Check if `.ensure` would help?
Instead of interrupting, it might be possible to feed a line to `flow`, and
  depending on where it ends up, use it?
  Related: `isConstruct` in html-flow may just be normal tokenizing, and then
  resolving it to outside of the HTML?
Do we have to consume EOFs? ðŸ¤”
hard break: should `hardBreakTrailing` exclude the line ending too?

- Flow HTML: Whitespace is fine in most places, but a blank line shouldnâ€™t be.
