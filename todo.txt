CMSM:

- email label -> email domain, email atext -> email local part
- “Autolink email atext state” `@` case must set `sizeLabel` to `0`, instead of `1`
- “Autolink email label state” `.` case must set `sizeLabel` to `0`, instead of incrementing it
- Use “HTML End” state (also in CDATA close) when expecting a `>` (comment end, tagOpenSelfClosing can use it)
- Allow `?` inside instructions, and allow `]]]]>` to end cdata.
- Use “HTML tag close inside” state should forward `>` to tag close between too.
- Use “HTML tag open inside” state should forward `>` to tag open between too.
- “HTML tag open inside state” should forward `/` too.
- Allow two boolean attributes
- tagOpenAttributeBefore should use “value” in name?
- Comment may not start with `>` or `->`.

CM:

- How do other character references work in HTML? E.g., `&copy` -> `&amp;copy`? What about HTMLs other numeric references? (e.g., the western set?)
- Is there a reason that ```` ```asd``  ```` does not work? Whereas `***asd**` does.
- What is the reason for `` `a\nb` `` becoming `a b` instead of `a\nb`, whereas line endings in text are preserved?
- Soft breaks: are only spaces trimmed? (dingus shows tabs too. )
- Hard breaks: is there a reason tabs, that in block structure act as 4 spaces, cannot be used to create hard breaks?
