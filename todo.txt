Things to check:
- [ ] Size/perf: feed more subtokenizers directly?
- [ ] Perf: use `resolveAll` instead of `resolveToLabelEnd` for label end.
- [ ] Perf: see if we can remove unneeded checks, interrupts, attempts, or other double parsing.
- [ ] Perf: instead of interrupting, we can do two things:
  1. Separate `content` chunks per line, let normal parsing make blocks and merge adjacent content
  2. On a successful interrupt, close content and use the events from interrupting
- [ ] Perf: more tests: <https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js/issues/129>
