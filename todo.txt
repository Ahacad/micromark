Shortlist:
- [x] Extensions
  - [ ] gfm: table / tableRow / tableCell / delete, checked list items
  - [ ] frontmatter: yaml, toml
  - [ ] footnotes: footnoteDefinition, footnote, footnoteReference
  - [ ] directives
  - [ ] mdx
- [ ] Performance

Size: go through code again for a while, could shave off a kb or so
Size: check if `.ensure` would help?
Size/perf: feed more subtokenizers directly?
Perf: use `resolveAll` instead of `resolveToLabelEnd` for label end.
Feat: create a generic hook, for any character? Needed for tables
Perf: see if we can remove unneeded checks, interrupts, attempts, or other double parsing.
Perf: instead of interrupting, we can do two things:
  1. Separate `content` chunks per line, let normal parsing make blocks and merge adjacent content
  2. On a successful interrupt, close content and use the events from interrupting
Perf: more tests: <https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js/issues/129>
