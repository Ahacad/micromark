Shortlist:
- Containers! Block quotes, Lists
- mdast compiler, mdast-util-to-markdown
- Extensions (frontmatter, gfm, mdx, directives, footnotes)
- Performance

Check if `.ensure` would help?
Flow: content. Feed directly into content tokenizer?
Assert that `.consume` is called if a token is open (except for eof?)
Create a generic hook, for any character? Could be useful for lists (instead of `[-*+1-9]`), indented code
Instead of interrupting, we can do two things:
  1. Separate `content` chunks per line, let normal parsing make blocks and merge adjacent content
  2. On a successful interrupt, close content and use the events from interrupting

- Flow HTML: Whitespace is fine in most places, but a blank line shouldnâ€™t be.
